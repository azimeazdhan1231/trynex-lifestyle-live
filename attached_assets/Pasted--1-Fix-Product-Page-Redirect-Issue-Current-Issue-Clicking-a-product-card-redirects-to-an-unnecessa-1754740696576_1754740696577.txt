1. Fix Product Page Redirect Issue
Current Issue: Clicking a product card redirects to an unnecessary page.

Required Fix:

Replace the redirect action with a modal popup that shows the full product details.

Modal should load dynamically via AJAX/fetch without page reload.

Modal must include all existing features: images, description, customization options, price, and purchase buttons.

2. Enhance Customization Features
Make the customization form fully dynamic and automated:

Color Picker: Allow customers to select colors; selected color should be shown in live preview and saved in order data.

Image Upload:

Allow customers to upload an image (PNG, JPG, JPEG, max size limit).

Uploaded image should preview instantly in the customization modal.

Send uploaded image to backend along with order.

Admin Panel Display:

Show customization instructions, selected colors, and uploaded images in Order Details.

Provide “Download Image” button in admin order view.

3. Add “Direct Order Now” Button
On product details/customization view:

Keep existing “Add to Cart” button.

Add a new “Direct Order Now” button.

Direct Order Now Flow:

Opens a modal/form requesting customer details (name, phone number, address).

Displays a 100৳ advance payment confirmation step (bKash/Nagad details + transaction ID input).

On submit, validate fields and store the order instantly in database.

Send order confirmation to admin and show success message to customer.

4. Improve Search Function
Implement a smart, YouTube-style search system:

Real-time suggestions as user types.

Partial matches, spelling tolerance, and relevance ranking.

Search across product names, descriptions, and categories.

Make search mobile-friendly and fast (debounce API calls).

5. Standardize Customization Button Functionality
Ensure both customization buttons:

Product Page “Customize” button

Customization Page “Customize” button

Have identical functionality and allow ordering with both “Add to Cart” and “Direct Order Now” options.

6. Fix Cart Modal Layout for Desktop
On desktop, the cart modal layout is broken/misaligned.

Fix:

Redesign cart modal for large screens so it’s centered, proportionate, and aesthetically consistent.

Ensure no horizontal scroll or cut-off content.

Apply same responsive fixes to all other modals (product view, customization, checkout).

7. Ensure Full Responsiveness & Touch Support
Test and optimize the entire site for:

Mobile (touch gestures, smooth scrolling, easy button tap areas).

Tablet.

Desktop.

Eliminate all touch unresponsiveness issues.

Ensure all modals and forms are usable with one hand on mobile.

8. CSS & UI/UX Professional Enhancement
Apply modern CSS styling to:

Modals.

Buttons (hover states, active states).

Forms.

Product cards.

Ensure consistent spacing, fonts, and colors across all pages.

Add smooth animations for modal open/close and button clicks.

Keep website visually appealing, user-friendly, and professional.
