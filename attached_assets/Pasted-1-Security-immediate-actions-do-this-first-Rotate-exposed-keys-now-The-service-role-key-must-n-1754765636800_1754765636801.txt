1) Security / immediate actions (do this first)
Rotate exposed keys now. The service role key must never be shipped to the browser. Regenerate keys in Supabase dashboard. 
supadex.app

Put secrets in server environment variables (Render/Netlify/Render environment) and only use the anon key in client code when appropriate. Use the service role key only in trusted server code (Edge Functions, server endpoints). 
supadex.app

Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on tables and write policies so only authorized users can read/write sensitive rows. Use RLS together with Supabase Auth for browser → DB security. 
Supabase

2) Architecture & where logic belongs
Frontend (Netlify / Vite / React / Vue)

Uses Supabase JS client + anon key for public reads (products, catalog).

Uses secure server endpoints for privileged operations (create promos, edit inventory, CRUD with service key) OR uses RLS to permit safe client operations.

Server / Edge functions (Render / Supabase Edge Functions / Netlify Functions)

Use for: privileged DB writes/reads, webhook handlers, generating reports, sending WhatsApp/bKash hooks, rotating keys, performing mass updates, and any operations requiring SERVICE_ROLE key.

Supabase features used: Postgres DB, Storage (for images), Realtime (for live order updates), Auth (customers + admin), Edge Functions (server tasks).

3) Database schema (core tables) — quick SQL blueprint
Below are minimal table designs. Add indexes and columns as needed.

sql
Copy
Edit
-- users (Supabase Auth handles auth; keep profile here)
create table profiles (
  id uuid primary key references auth.users(id),
  full_name text,
  phone text,
  role text default 'customer',
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- categories
create table categories (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  name text not null,
  slug text unique,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- products
create table products (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  sku text unique,
  title text not null,
  description text,
  price numeric(10,2) not null,
  category_id uuid references categories(id),
  images jsonb default '[]',
  stock integer default 0,
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- promo codes / offers
create table promos (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  code text unique not null,
  discount_type text check (discount_type in ('flat','percent')),
  discount_value numeric,
  starts_at timestamptz,
  ends_at timestamptz,
  active boolean default true,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- orders
create table orders (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid references profiles(id),
  total numeric(10,2),
  status text default 'pending', -- pending, processing, completed, canceled
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  updated_at timestamptz default now(),
  metadata jsonb -- store shipping address, timezone, payment_id, etc
);

-- order items
create table order_items (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  order_id uuid references orders(id) on delete cascade,
  product_id uuid references products(id),
  qty integer not null,
  price numeric(10,2) not null,
  customization jsonb, -- store text, images paths, options
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);
Store image URLs/paths in products.images and store uploaded custom images in Supabase Storage buckets; save the resulting public/private URL in order_items.customization as needed.

4) File / image upload & serving
Use Supabase Storage buckets. Create separate buckets:

product-images (public or CDN-enabled)

order-uploads (private — require signed URLs)

Upload flow:

Client uploads to storage using anon key (if allowed) or upload via a signed URL generated by server function (recommended for private files).

Save resulting public URL or signed URL reference into the relevant DB row (order_items.customization.images = ['bucket/path']). 
Supabase

Show previews in admin panel by either public URL or by generating signed URLs server-side for private buckets.

5) Realtime order updates (admin panel live updates)
Use Supabase Realtime to subscribe to orders and order_items table changes. When an order row or order_items row changes, broadcast to connected admin clients to update UI instantly. Supabase supports Postgres changes and recommended Broadcast channels for scalability.

Implementation outline:

Client subscribes to channels: orders:status, orders:created, order_items:created etc.

On subscription event, update the admin UI state (e.g., update order list, open order modal or increment badge).

Alternative: Use server-side websockets or a custom broadcast if you need heavy scaling.

6) Customize modal & custom order flow (fixes)
Problems you reported (not responsive, not saving images/text) → fixes:

Frontend: Make modal responsive (flex + grid), and mobile-first. Ensure inputs can accept text and file uploads.

Client validation: Validate files (size, extension) and show previews immediately.

Save flow: On submit, upload files to order-uploads bucket first, collect URLs, then submit order payload to /orders API that inserts DB rows and order_items including customization JSON containing uploaded file paths. Do not rely solely on client local state — persist ASAP.

Admin: In View Order modal, fetch order + order_items (includes customization) and render images (signed URLs if private). If images are missing, check upload step and storage response logs. Use Edge Functions to rehydrate missing references if necessary.

7) CRUD & Admin features mapping
You asked for full CRUD for products, categories, offers, promo codes, and user/inventory management. Implementation notes:

Products: CRUD via admin UI → endpoints call DB. Use products.images to store list of image paths; support multiple uploads and drag-drop UI.

Categories: Simple CRUD table with slug uniqueness.

Promos/Offers: CRUD with validation (date ranges, stacking rules).

Inventory: Track stock in products and create stock_transactions table for changes, with low-stock triggers that push notifications (email, dashboard alerts).

Users: Admin can view profiles, reset password links (via Supabase Auth), and deactivate.

Reports & Dashboard: Use SQL queries/ materialized views to compute daily sales, top products, conversion rates. Expose via an admin-only API and render charts in the dashboard. (You can compute heavy reports server-side and cache results.)

8) Timezone handling (Bangladesh time)
Store timestamps in UTC (Postgres timestamptz). Convert to Asia/Dhaka (UTC+06:00) when displaying in the frontend or in the admin. Example in JS: new Date(dbTimestamp).toLocaleString('en-US', { timeZone: 'Asia/Dhaka' }). This guarantees consistent storage and correct display for BST. 
Supabase

9) Background tasks & business logic
Use Supabase Edge Functions or Render cron jobs for:

Sending order confirmation emails/WhatsApp messages.

Generating daily sales reports.

Handling long-running image processing or resizing.

Keep any operation requiring service role key inside these server-side functions.

10) Row-Level Security & policies (example)
Enable RLS on orders and add policies:

Allow users to SELECT their own orders: using ( auth.uid() = user_id )

Allow admins (role 'admin') to read all orders.

This prevents anon key exploits and ensures safe client operations. 
Supabase

11) Testing & QA checklist (practical)
Rotate keys and confirm clients still work.

End-to-end test: place order with customization + file upload — verify files in storage + entries in orders/order_items.

Admin: open order details modal — confirm text + image load and timezone correct.

Update order status in admin — confirm realtime update to frontend/other admin clients.

Test CRUD for products, categories, promos — check file upload, previews, validations.

Simulate low-stock and confirm alerts.

Run security audit: RLS policies, no service key in client, test anon key permissions.

Backup strategy: set up nightly DB dumps and storage backups.

12) Deployment checklist & recommended stack pieces
Client: Netlify (or Vercel) — builds + public assets.

Server: Render / Supabase Edge Functions — host server endpoints and privileged tasks.

Database + Storage: Supabase (you already have).

Monitoring & Logs: Sentry (errors), Supabase logs for DB/storage, and uptime checks.

13) Final notes & offer
Yes, your current Supabase instance can support everything, but first rotate those keys and lock down RLS.
